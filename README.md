The platform provides interactive data visualization through dynamic charts that display grade trends and course progress, giving students clear insights into their academic performance. An integrated task management system allows users to create, track, and prioritize assignments with deadline reminders and completion tracking.Built with a Python backend and SQLite database, it ensures secure data storage while delivering a seamless user experience through its clean HTML/CSS/JS interface.

# Technologies Used
This project was built with a powerful combination of front-end and back-end technologies:

Backend: Python with Flask - To handle the server logic, process data, and manage communication between the user and the database.

Frontend:

HTML - The standard markup language for creating the structure of the web pages.

CSS - Used for styling and designing a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

JavaScript - Adds interactivity to the dashboard, like dynamic updates, button clicks, and menu toggles.

Database: SQLite - A lightweight, serverless database engine that stores all the student data, including grades, tasks, and user information reliably.


# Output
The output of this code is a fully functional, interactive web applicationâ€”the Personalized Student Dashboard itself. When you run the code, it generates:

A Visual Dashboard: A single webpage that serves as a central hub for students. It's not just text; it's a complete graphical interface with menus, cards, charts, and lists.

Interactive Elements:

Charts that update: You can see your grade trends over time in a visual graph.

A dynamic to-do list: You can add, edit, check off, and delete tasks.

A live calendar: It displays your schedule and upcoming events.

Personalized Data Display: The main output is a summary of a student's academic life. It takes data (like grades, assignments, and schedules) and presents it in an easy-to-understand, visual format, helping students make sense of their progress quickly.
